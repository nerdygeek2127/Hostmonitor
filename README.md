# Hostmonitor
The Host Monitor is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It is designed to monitor the status of multiple hosts (IP addresses or hostnames) by pinging them at specified intervals. The application can handle up to 250 hosts simultaneously, providing real-time feedback on the status of each host.
